##Â Installation

Open project folder in terminal and run ```yarn``` or ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies

## Technology Used

I used React for the front end of this project, as well as Bootstrap as a front end library. API provided by https://www.football-data.org/.

## General Approach

Intention was to create a responsive front end to display upcoming and finished Premier League football matches, and allow users to filter matches based on status and their favourite teams.
